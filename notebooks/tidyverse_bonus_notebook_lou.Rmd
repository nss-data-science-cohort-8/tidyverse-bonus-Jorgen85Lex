This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
```


1. Read in `districts.csv` into a tibble named `districts`.
```{r}
districts <- read.csv("../Documents/NSS_Projects/tidyverse-un-Jorgen85Lex/tidyverse-bonus-Jorgen85Lex/data/districts.csv")

districts
```
2. Notice that the first row corresponds to the whole State of Tennessee. Remove this row and save the result back to `districts`.

```{r}
districts <- districts[-1,]
districts
```
3. How many districts have a proficiency rate of at least 80% for both alg_1 and eng_1?

```{r}
filtered_80 <- districts |> 
  filter(alg_1 >= 80 & eng_1 >= 80)

filtered_80
```
```{r}
count(filtered_80)
```

4. How many districts have a proviciency rate less than 50% for either alg_1 or eng_1?

```{r}
filtered_under50<- districts |> 
  filter(alg_1<50 & eng_1<50)

filtered_under50
```
```{r}
count(filtered_under50)
```
5. Which district has the lowest graduation rate?

```{r}
grad_rate <- districts |> 
  arrange(grad)

head(grad_rate, 1)
```
6. Within the Mid Cumberland region, which district has the highest ACT composite?

```{r}
MidCumberland <- districts |> 
  filter(region == "Mid Cumberland") |> 
  arrange(desc(act_composite))

head(MidCumberland, 1)
```
7. Create a scatter plot to compare alg_1 proficiency rates to alg_2 rates. What do you notice? Facet this plot by region. Does anything stand out when you facet the plots?

```{r}
districts_scatter <- districts |>
  select(1, 2, 3, 4, 27)

districts_scatter
```

```{r}
districts_for_scatterplot <- districts_scatter |> 
drop_na(alg_1, alg_2)
```

```{r}
ggplot(districts_scatter, aes( x= alg_1, y = alg_2))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~region)
```
They all seem to have somewhat of a postive correlation. 

8. When creating this bar chart you may have noticed that some districts have missing enrollment values. For how many districts is this the case?

```{r}
missing_enrollment <- sum(is.na(districts_scatter$alg_1) | is.na(districts_scatter$alg_2))
missing_enrollment
```
9. A lot of rows are missing additional values. Which district has the largest number of missing values (across all variables)? Hint: you might want to look at rowwise and c_across to answer this question.


```{r}
districts |>
  mutate(across(everything(), as.character)) |> 
  rowwise() |> 
  mutate(missing_count = sum(is.na(c_across(everything())))) |> 
  ungroup() |> 
  group_by(system_name) |> 
  summarise(total_missing = sum(missing_count)) |> 
  arrange(desc(total_missing)) |> 
  slice(1)
```

10. What is the mean graduation rate across all districts? What might be wrong with using just the regular mean to assess average graduation rates?

the regular mean doesn't really take into account students enrolled in each district. So doing more of a weighted mean I think is the way to go here. 


```{r}
simple_mean_grad_rate <- mean(districts$grad, na.rm = TRUE)
            
simple_mean_grad_rate
```
11. Redo the previous question but use a weighted average (`weighted.mean`) graduation across all districts, weighing by enrollment. How much does this change your answer? Can you explain using the data the reason for the big change from using the mean?

```{r}
mean_grad_rate <- districts |>
  filter(!is.na(grad) & !is.na(enrollment)) |> 
  summarise(mean_grad_rate = weighted.mean(grad, enrollment))
            
mean_grad_rate
```
These values are slightly off because you do have to take into account the amount of students enrolled in each district to get the more accurate mean. 

12. Find the unweighted and weighted average graduation rate by district.

```{r}
unweighted_avg_grad_rate <- districts |> 
  group_by(system_name) |> 
  summarise(unweighted_avg_grad_rate = mean(grad, na.rm = TRUE))

unweighted_avg_grad_rate
```
```{r}
weighted_avg_grad_rate <- districts |> 
  group_by(system_name) |> 
  summarise(weighted_avg_grad_rate = weighted.mean(grad, enrollment, na.rm = TRUE))

weighted_avg_grad_rate
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
